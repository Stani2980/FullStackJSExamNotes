# Question 13)
## Plain JavaScript

#### Explain about the Event Loop in Node.js
>JavaScript is a single threaded language, meaning that originally we could not preform async. requests. Thats where we use a web API, supplied by the V8 engine. This allows us to kick our async. functions over in a C++ code that executes them, and returns them when ready.
>The loop goes as so : 
>Func() enters the Call Stack in JS, if it is a async function, it will be sent to the web API, witch will execute the async code, then it will get sent to the call Queue, where it sits until the CallStack is empty and ready to execute the next task. 

#### Explain and demonstrate how es2015 supports modules (import and export) similar to what is offered by NodeJS
>The syntax has changed, and we can now deconstruct the imports, `require('')` is node.js specific, and not a part of JS. Now import is native to the js language.

#### Explain, using relevant examples, about testing JavaScript code, relevant packages (Mocha etc.) and how to test asynchronous code (see next question, and if it makes sense, use the same code example for this and the next question)
> We use Mocha a testing library, and we use Chai an assertion library, to perform test. The asynchronous tests, are created via async/await keywords(Promises).

## GraphQL, Period-4
#### Demonstrate and highlight important parts of a “complete” GraphQL-app using Express and MongoDB on the server side, and Apollo-Client on the client.
